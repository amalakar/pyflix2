pyflix2: python module for accessing Netflix webservice
=======================================================

Netflix discontinuting developer program
----------------------------------------
Unfortunately netflix has stopped issuing new developer api keys: https://techcrunch.com/2013/03/08/netflix-stops-issuing-api-keys-to-new-developers-effectively-ending-its-developer-program/ I haven't tested if the api endpoint are still available or now.


Introduction
------------

*pyflix2* is a `BSD licensed` python module for accessing netflix API (both v1 and v2)
Netflix provides REST interfaces to access it's catalog and various user data.
This module exposes easy to use object oriented interfaces that is inteded to make it even easier
for python programmers to use.

Install
-------
Installing requests is simple with `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_::

    $ pip install pyflix2

or, with `easy_install <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_::

    $ easy_install pyflix2


Example
-------

::

    from pyflix2 import *

    netflix = NetflixAPIV2( 'appname', 'key', 'shared_secret')
    movies = netflix.title_autocomplete('Terminator', filter='instant')
    for title in movies['autocomplete']['title']:
        print title

    user = netflix.get_user('use_id', 'access_token', 'access_token_secret')
    reco = user.get_reccomendations()
    for movie in reco['recommendations']:
        print movie['title']['regular']

Note
    - Here ``appname``, ``key`` and ``shared_secret`` needs to be obtained from: http://developer.netflix.com/apps/mykeys.
    - The ``user_id``, ``access_token``, ``access_token_secret`` needs to be obtained programmatically using ``get_request_token``
      and ``get_access_token``

::

    $ python -mpyflix2 -s 'the matrix' -x 

Or see help::

    $ python -mpyflix2 -h
